    "# What is TSCC?\n",
    "- The [Triton Shared Computing Cluster (TSCC)](https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/tscc-quick-start.html) is the cluster that we (Yeo lab, others at UCSD) use for processing and analysis of single-cell RNASeq data. It is a part of the [San Diego Supercomputer Center](https://www.sdsc.edu/) which has an administrative team that helps us create/restore backups, install top-level updates, and manage the job submission software for scripts that can be distributed across multiple machines (nodes). \n",
    "- Having an external administrative team is useful for reducing the engineering overhead, however this also means we lack administrative (superuser, or \"[sudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo)\") privileges. <b>This is common among labs within large organizations and Universities</b>. Software that requires these privileges needs either a workaround or administrator help. "

    "# Terminology\n",
    "- **Unix**: Unix is a family of operating systems (think Windows or MacOS). Linux is a free* version of Unix, which has become the core for many distributions such as Centos, Ubuntu, and Fedora, each which specializes in different things. Since we're mostly going to be using Python and R (*scripting or interpreted language* as opposed to *compiled languages* like C or Java), it doesn't really matter which Unix distribution we're using so as long as the Python or R interpreter is installed. MacOSX was designed with Unix principles in mind, making it partially compatible with Unix and a popular choice among bioinformaticians. \n",
    "- **HPC**: High-Performance Computing (HPC) simply describes a computing environment specialized for high throughput or computationally demanding analysis. HPC clusters usually require additional software to manage job (script) submission and resources within and across its network of nodes (computers). TSCC uses the [TORQUE resource manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TORQUE), so we will be running jobs by wrapping them inside TORQUE scripts (qscripts) and submitting them to the TORQUE resource manager. **Note**: Other HPC clusters may use other resource managers (SLURM is another popular one) and therefore will have different syntax, but the idea is the same.\n",
    "- **Anaconda**: Anaconda is an open-source distribution (collection of softwares) for scientific computing. It contains the Python interpreter as well as a bunch of other useful software packages (such as Scipy, Jupyter, Numpy, etc.), and conda. \n",
    "- **Conda**: conda is a package manager, or software that helps organize these packages, plus any dependencies, versions, metadata that comes with it.\n",
    "- **Containers**: a container is a unit of software that essentially wraps a package or distribution along with all dependencies in a portable/reproducible way. For our purposes, we can think of containers as easy ways to share a software installation.\n",
    "- **Singularity**: One popular containerization technology (another being Docker) that we will be using to share the software that you will be using throughout this course. Singularity containers (images) can be shared via two ways: the image itself (a single, larger file containing an operating system and any of the packages installed), or via instructions to create the image. We have several pre-made Singularity images on TSCC which can be called/accessed/run with another package management system called \"modules\". \n",
    "- **Local/remote**: \"Local\" usually refers to your own laptop/desktop, while \"remote\" will typically refer to the cluster or cloud instance that you are connecting to. You will almost always have a separate set of credentials (username/password) for each (for example, my local username is \"brianyee\" while my username on TSCC may be something like \"ucsd-train03\").\n",
    "- **Node (Cluster)**: A single node is one server/machine/computer. A cluster is comprised of a group of nodes. Each node that we have access to provides up to 16 cores (processors) and up to 126Gb of memory, managed by the job scheduler (Maui) and the resource manager (TORQUE). "
